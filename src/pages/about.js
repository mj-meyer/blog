        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm MJ Meyer, a front-end developer from Pretoria, South Africa. I
          love crafting amazing experiences with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and
          have been doing so for the last 10 years. I hang out on Twitter and
          would love to meet you üëã.
        </p>
        <h2>In Detail</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm passionate about user experience design, development, and helping
          businesses tell their story. My current role is as lead front-end
          engineer on the InfoSlips product team. From a technical standpoint, I
          spend most of my time working with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. On the
          JavaScript side, I mostly work with Angular, but I‚Äôm always exploring
          to learn something new. I‚Äôm a firm believer in TDD and Agile
          methodologies.
        </p>
        <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
        <p>
          After completing a one year web development course through CTU, I
          spent the next 5 years creating websites for small businesses at a web
          agency. Although I had worn many hats ‚Äì I was fast tracked into a
          Creative Director role (and running the business, looong story) ‚Äì I
          needed a challenge and I knew I would find fulfilment in a more
          developer focused role. Long story short, I joined the InfoSlips team
          and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
        </p>
        <h2>When I‚Äôm Not Coding</h2>
        <p>
          I love to spend time with my beautiful wife Annelien, my daughter Ava,
          and chilling around a braai (it‚Äôs a bbq for those outside South
          Africa) with friends and family. I‚Äôm known to make some pretty wicked
          burgers, pork belly and pizzas on my Weber üòâ When I need some ‚Äúme‚Äù
          time, I‚Äôm usually jamming some Xbox, Netflix and chill, or Crossfit to
          blow-off some steam.
        </p>
        <h2>Where I‚Äôm Going</h2>
        <p>
          My next goal is becoming a skilled full-stack developer. My love will
          always be front-end development, and I‚Äôm not sure if my full-time job
          title needs to be full-stack developer, but I would prefer having the
          option. InfoSlips has already started expanding to the USA and I would
          really love to move my little family there in the next few years. So
          hopefully I can update this bio sometime with a new location and
          skillset üòú
