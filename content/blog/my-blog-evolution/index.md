title: The Evolution Of My Blog

Nope. I haven’t had a secret blog for the last 10 years. Although, I have attempted to start one PLENTY of times, but each time I want it perfect… So it ends up taking forever, I get busy or forget and then a year or two later the design is dated.

This time around, I thought it may be pretty cool to have a living document of sorts that shows how my blog changes over time. This way, I finally get something out there, warts and all, but it makes for something interesting to write about.

To prevent this post becoming a 10k-word essay, I’m going to use this post as an index of sorts. So I’ll link to each new post and each post individually will link back here.
